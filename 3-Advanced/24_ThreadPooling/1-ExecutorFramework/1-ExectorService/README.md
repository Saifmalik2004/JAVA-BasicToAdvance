# Java Executor Framework - A Beginner to Advanced Guide

## Introduction

In Java, managing multiple threads manually can be complex and inefficient. The **Executor Framework** simplifies multithreading by providing a structured way to manage thread execution, improving performance and resource management.

This guide explains the **Executor Framework**, its **three core interfaces**, and the **methods of ExecutorService in detail**, using simple explanations, real-world analogies, and Java code examples.

## Understanding the Executor Framework

### What is the Executor Framework?

The **Executor Framework** in Java provides a **high-level replacement for traditional thread management** using a pool of worker threads. Instead of creating and managing threads manually, you submit tasks to an executor, which handles execution efficiently.

### Why is it Important?

- **Improves performance** by reusing existing threads instead of creating new ones.
- **Manages resource allocation** efficiently, preventing excessive thread creation.
- **Simplifies multi-threaded programming**, reducing complexity and errors.
- **Provides additional features** like scheduling and parallel execution.

### Real-World Analogy

Think of an **Executor** like a restaurant kitchen. Instead of every customer cooking their own meal (manual thread management), chefs (executor threads) prepare orders efficiently. The restaurant manager (ExecutorService) decides which chef takes the next order, ensuring no one is overwhelmed.

## Core Components of the Executor Framework

The Executor Framework has **three core interfaces**:

1. **Executor** - A simple interface for executing tasks.
2. **ExecutorService** - Extends `Executor`, adding features like thread pool management and task scheduling.
3. **ScheduledExecutorService** - Extends `ExecutorService`, allowing tasks to be scheduled at fixed rates or delays.

## Understanding `Executor`

The `Executor` interface provides a simple way to execute a task.

### Example:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.Executor;

class SimpleExecutor implements Executor {
    @Override
    public void execute(Runnable command) {
        new Thread(command).start();
    }
}

public class ExecutorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Executor executor = new SimpleExecutor();
        executor.execute(() -> System.out.println("Task is running..."));
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- The `execute(Runnable command)` method runs a task in a new thread.
- This is a basic implementation, but Java provides **ExecutorService** for better control.

---

## `ExecutorService` - Advanced Thread Management

`ExecutorService` extends `Executor` and provides methods to manage lifecycle and execution of tasks.

### Key Methods of `ExecutorService`

### **1. `submit(Runnable task)`**
- Submits a `Runnable` task for execution and returns a `Future<?>` representing the task.
- The task **does not return a result**.

#### **Example:**
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;

public class SubmitRunnableExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);

        Future<?> future = executor.submit(() -> {
            System.out.println("Runnable Task Executed");
        });

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```
✅ *Use Case:* When you need to run a background task but don’t need a result.

---

### **2. `submit(Callable<T> task)`**
- Submits a `Callable` task for execution and returns a `Future<T>`, allowing retrieval of results.

#### **Example:**
```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class SubmitCallableExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);

        Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(() -> {
            return 10 + 20;
        });

        System.out.println("Result: " + future.get()); // Waits for the result

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```
✅ *Use Case:* When you need a task to return a result after execution.

---

### **3. `shutdown()`**
- Initiates an **orderly shutdown**: ongoing tasks finish, but no new tasks are accepted.

#### **Example:**
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class ShutdownExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);

        executor.submit(() -> System.out.println("Task Executed"));

        executor.shutdown(); // No new tasks accepted
        System.out.println("Executor Shutdown Started");
    }
}
```
✅ *Use Case:* When you want to stop accepting new tasks while allowing existing ones to finish.

---

### **4. `shutdownNow()`**
- Immediately attempts to stop all running tasks and returns a list of pending tasks.

#### **Example:**
```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class ShutdownNowExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);

        executor.submit(() -> {
            try { Thread.sleep(5000); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
            System.out.println("Task Executed");
        });

        List<Runnable> pendingTasks = executor.shutdownNow(); // Stops all tasks
        System.out.println("Pending tasks: " + pendingTasks.size());
    }
}
```
✅ *Use Case:* When you need to **force stop** execution (e.g., app shutdown).

---

### **5. `awaitTermination(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)`**
- Waits for all tasks to finish or times out.

#### **Example:**
```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class AwaitTerminationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);
        executor.submit(() -> System.out.println("Task Executed"));

        executor.shutdown();
        if (executor.awaitTermination(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
            System.out.println("All tasks completed.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Timeout reached before tasks completed.");
        }
    }
}
```
✅ *Use Case:* When you need to **gracefully wait** for all tasks to finish.

---

### **6. `isShutdown()` and `isTerminated()`**
- `isShutdown()` → Returns true if shutdown was requested.
- `isTerminated()` → Returns true if all tasks completed after shutdown.

#### **Example:**
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class IsShutdownExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);
        executor.submit(() -> System.out.println("Task Executed"));

        executor.shutdown();
        System.out.println("Executor is shutdown: " + executor.isShutdown());
        System.out.println("Executor is terminated: " + executor.isTerminated());
    }
}
```
✅ *Use Case:* When checking if an executor has completely stopped.

---

### **7. `invokeAll(Collection<Callable<T>> tasks)`**
- Executes multiple `Callable` tasks **concurrently** and returns a list of `Future<T>` results.

#### **Example:**
```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class InvokeAllExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        List<Callable<String>> tasks = Arrays.asList(
            () -> "Task 1 Completed",
            () -> "Task 2 Completed",
            () -> "Task 3 Completed"
        );

        List<Future<String>> results = executor.invokeAll(tasks);

        for (Future<String> result : results) {
            System.out.println(result.get()); // Waits for each task to finish
        }

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```
✅ *Use Case:* When you need to execute multiple tasks and wait for **all** results.

---

### **8. `invokeAny(Collection<Callable<T>> tasks)`**
- Executes multiple `Callable` tasks and **returns the result of the first completed task**.

#### **Example:**
```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class InvokeAnyExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        List<Callable<String>> tasks = Arrays.asList(
            () -> { Thread.sleep(3000); return "Task 1"; },
            () -> { Thread.sleep(1000); return "Task 2"; },
            () -> { Thread.sleep(2000); return "Task 3"; }
        );

        String result = executor.invokeAny(tasks);
        System.out.println("First completed task result: " + result);

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```
✅ *Use Case:* When you need the **fastest result** from multiple tasks.

---

### **9. Understanding `Future<T>`**
A `Future<T>` represents a **pending result** of an asynchronous computation.

#### **Methods:**
- `get()` - Waits for and retrieves the result.
- `isDone()` - Checks if computation is finished.
- `cancel()` - Attempts to cancel the task.

#### **Example:**
```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class FutureExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);

        Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(() -> 10 + 20);
        System.out.println("Task Completed: " + future.isDone());

        System.out.println("Result: " + future.get()); // Waits for result

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```
✅ *Use Case:* When handling asynchronous computations.

### **Understanding Generics in `Future<T>`**  

Before diving deep into Generics, let's understand how `Future<T>` uses them.  

#### **What is `Future<T>`?**  
- `Future<T>` is a generic interface in Java that represents the result of an **asynchronous computation**.
- The `<T>` in `Future<T>` means that it can return **any type** of result when the computation is complete.  

#### **Example: Using `Future<T>` with Different Types**  

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class FutureGenericsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);

        // Future<Integer>
        Future<Integer> futureInt = executor.submit(() -> 100 + 200);
        System.out.println("Integer Result: " + futureInt.get());

        // Future<String>
        Future<String> futureString = executor.submit(() -> "Hello, Future!");
        System.out.println("String Result: " + futureString.get());

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

### **Why Use Generics in `Future<T>`?**  
- It ensures **type safety** → You know the expected return type at compile-time.
- You don’t need to manually cast the result → Avoids `ClassCastException`.

#### **What About `Future<?>` (Wildcard in Generics)?**  

You might also encounter `Future<?>`, which uses a wildcard. This represents a **Future of some unknown type**. It is useful when you don’t need to know the exact type, but you still want to handle the result in a generic way.  

For example, let’s say we are working with a `Future` that can return anything, but we don’t care about the specific type. This could be the case when you're handling multiple types of tasks asynchronously, but you’re just interested in getting the result without worrying about its type.

#### **Example: Using `Future<?>`**  

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class FutureWildcardExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);

        // Future<?> with unknown type
        Future<?> futureTask = executor.submit(() -> "This is a wildcard result");
        System.out.println("Wildcard Result: " + futureTask.get());

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}

```

#### **Why Use `Future<?>`?**  
- It allows you to handle results of unknown types in a generic way.
- However, you lose the ability to access specific methods of the return type since it’s unknown (`futureTask.get()` will return `Object`).


We will learn more about **Generics** later, including **wildcards (`?`), bounded types (`extends`, `super`), and custom generic classes**. But for now, just understand that:
- `<T>` in `Future<T>` allows it to work with **any data type**.
- `<?>` is useful for working with unknown types when you don’t need to know the specific return type.
