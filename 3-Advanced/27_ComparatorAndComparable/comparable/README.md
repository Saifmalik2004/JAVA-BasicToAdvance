# Comparable Interface in Java

## Introduction
The `Comparable` interface in Java is a fundamental interface used to define a natural ordering for objects of a class. It allows objects to be compared to each other, making sorting operations more efficient. This interface is particularly useful when working with collections that need to be ordered, such as `TreeSet`, `TreeMap`, or when sorting lists using `Collections.sort()`.

## Why is Comparable Important?
- Enables sorting of custom objects in a natural order.
- Used in many Java standard library classes.
- Provides a clean and consistent way to define ordering for objects.

## Key Concept: Natural Ordering
The `Comparable` interface defines a single method:

```java
public interface Comparable<T> {
    int compareTo(T o);
}
```

This method compares the current object with another object of the same type and returns:
- A negative integer if the current object is less than the specified object.
- Zero if both objects are equal.
- A positive integer if the current object is greater than the specified object.

## Real-World Analogy
Imagine sorting students in a class based on their marks. Each student has an ID and a score, and we need to arrange them in ascending order based on their scores. The `Comparable` interface helps define this sorting logic inside the `Student` class.

## Implementing Comparable: Example
Here is an example of a `Student` class implementing `Comparable`:

```java
class Student implements Comparable<Student> {
    private String name;
    private int marks;
    
    public Student(String name, int marks) {
        this.name = name;
        this.marks = marks;
    }
    
    @Override
    public int compareTo(Student other) {
        return Integer.compare(this.marks, other.marks);
    }
    
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return name + " - " + marks;
    }
}
```

## Using Comparable with Sorting
To sort a list of students:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();
        students.add(new Student("Alice", 85));
        students.add(new Student("Bob", 75));
        students.add(new Student("Charlie", 95));
        
        Collections.sort(students);
        
        System.out.println(students);
    }
}
```

### Output:
```
Bob - 75
Alice - 85
Charlie - 95
```

## Common Mistakes & FAQs

### 1. What if we need multiple sorting criteria?
The `Comparable` interface only provides one natural ordering. If you need multiple sorting criteria, use the `Comparator` interface instead.

### 2. What happens if compareTo() is not implemented correctly?
If `compareTo()` does not return consistent results (e.g., it violates transitivity), sorting algorithms may behave unpredictably.

### 3. Can we sort objects in descending order?
Yes, by reversing the comparison logic in `compareTo()`:

```java
@Override
public int compareTo(Student other) {
    return Integer.compare(other.marks, this.marks);
}
```

### 4. How does Comparable differ from Comparator?
| Feature        | Comparable | Comparator |
|---------------|-----------|------------|
| Interface     | `Comparable<T>` | `Comparator<T>` |
| Method       | `compareTo(T o)` | `compare(T o1, T o2)` |
| Sorting Order | Natural ordering (only one) | Custom ordering (multiple) |
| Usage        | Used inside the class | Used externally |
| Modifies Class? | Yes | No |
