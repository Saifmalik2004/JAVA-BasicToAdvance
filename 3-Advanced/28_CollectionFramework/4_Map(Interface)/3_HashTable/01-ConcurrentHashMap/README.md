# **ConcurrentHashMap in Java 🚀**

## **Introduction**

### **What is ConcurrentHashMap?**
`ConcurrentHashMap` is a thread-safe, high-performance implementation of `Map` introduced in Java 5 as part of `java.util.concurrent`. Unlike `Hashtable`, which synchronizes every operation, `ConcurrentHashMap` **allows concurrent access** by multiple threads without locking the entire map.

### **Why is ConcurrentHashMap Important?**
In a multi-threaded environment, `ConcurrentHashMap` provides:
✔ **High performance** compared to synchronized maps (`Hashtable`, `Collections.synchronizedMap()`).  
✔ **Non-blocking reads** while allowing concurrent updates.  
✔ **Segmented locking** (before Java 8) to minimize contention.  
✔ **Better scalability** in concurrent applications.  

### **Real-life Analogy** 📌
Think of `ConcurrentHashMap` as a **shared whiteboard in an office**:
- Multiple employees (threads) can **read** from the whiteboard simultaneously.  
- When someone **writes** (modifies an entry), only that section (bucket) is locked, while others can still read and write in other sections.  
- Unlike a `Hashtable`, which locks the entire board for every update, `ConcurrentHashMap` ensures **efficient multi-threaded access**.

```

### **Key Points:**
- `ConcurrentHashMap` implements **ConcurrentMap** and extends `AbstractMap`.
- Unlike `HashMap`, it does **not allow `null` keys or values**.
- Uses **lock-free reads** and **fine-grained locking for updates**.

## **Key Features of ConcurrentHashMap 🚀**

✅ **Thread-Safe & Lock-Free Reads** – Multiple threads can read concurrently **without blocking**.  
✅ **Fine-Grained Locking** – Before Java 8, uses **segment-based locking** (lock striping). Since Java 8, it uses **CAS (Compare-And-Swap) operations** for atomic updates.  
✅ **High Performance** – Better than `Hashtable` and `synchronizedMap` in concurrent environments.  
✅ **Does Not Allow Null Keys or Values** – Prevents confusion in concurrent updates.  
✅ **Atomic Operations** – Supports `putIfAbsent()`, `compute()`, `merge()`, etc., ensuring safe updates.

## **How ConcurrentHashMap Works Internally? 🛠️**

### **1. Before Java 8 (Segmented Locking)**
- The map was **divided into segments**.
- Each segment had an independent **ReentrantLock**, allowing parallel writes in different segments.
- Provided better concurrency than `Hashtable`, but still had **lock contention** when updating the same segment.

### **2. After Java 8 (Bucket-Level Locking + CAS)**
- Uses **lock-free operations** for most reads (`get()`).
- Uses **CAS (Compare-And-Swap)** for updates, reducing locking needs.
- Only locks **individual buckets** when necessary, improving performance.

### **CAS (Compare-And-Swap) Operation in Java: Explained with Real-Life Analogy and Example**  

---

### **What is CAS (Compare-And-Swap)?**
CAS (Compare-And-Swap) is an **atomic operation** used in multithreading to update a variable **without using locks**. It helps in implementing non-blocking algorithms, which improve performance in high-concurrency environments.

💡 **Concept:**  
CAS works by checking if a variable has an expected value. If yes, it updates it to a new value **atomically**; otherwise, it retries until successful.

---
### **Real-Life Analogy: ATM PIN Change**
Imagine you go to an **ATM** to change your PIN. The process follows **CAS logic**:

1. **Step 1:** You **enter your old PIN** (expected value).  
2. **Step 2:** The ATM **checks** if the old PIN matches the bank's records.  
3. **Step 3:** If it matches, the ATM **updates it to the new PIN** (new value). ✅  
4. **Step 4:** If someone else changed the PIN before you confirmed, the ATM **rejects your update**, and you must **retry**. 🔄  

**This is how CAS works in Java – checking an expected value before updating.**

---

### **How CAS Works Internally in Java**
1. **Read the current value (`V`) from memory.**  
2. **Compare it with the expected value (`E`).**  
3. - If `V == E`, update it to `NewValue` (`N`). ✅  
   - If `V != E`, do nothing (or retry). 🔄  

💡 CAS avoids **locks** by letting threads update only if no one else has changed the value.

---

### **CAS in Java (Example using `AtomicInteger`)**
Java provides **CAS-based atomic operations** in the `java.util.concurrent.atomic` package.  

#### **Example: Updating a Shared Counter**
```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

public class CASExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger(0);

        // Simulating CAS operation
        int expectedValue = 0;
        int newValue = 1;

        // Compare: If counter == expectedValue, update it to newValue
        boolean success = counter.compareAndSet(expectedValue, newValue);

        System.out.println("Was CAS successful? " + success);
        System.out.println("Updated counter value: " + counter.get());
    }
}
```

**🔹 Output:**
```
Was CAS successful? true
Updated counter value: 1
```

💡 If another thread had changed `counter` before this operation, `compareAndSet` would have **failed**.

---

### **Where is CAS Used in Java?**
1. **`AtomicInteger`, `AtomicLong`, `AtomicBoolean`** – For atomic updates.  
2. **`ConcurrentHashMap`** – For thread-safe map operations.  
3. **`ConcurrentLinkedQueue`** – Non-blocking queue implementation.  
4. **`LongAdder` / `DoubleAdder`** – Optimized for high-contention updates.  

---

### **Limitations of CAS**
| **Limitation**  | **Explanation** |
|---------------|----------------|
| **ABA Problem**  | If a value changes from `A → B → A`, CAS may think nothing changed. **Solution:** Use `AtomicStampedReference`. |
| **Spin-loop inefficiency** | If multiple threads keep retrying, CPU cycles are wasted. **Solution:** Use backoff strategies. |
| **Limited to single variables** | CAS operates on one value at a time. **Solution:** Use `AtomicReference` for composite objects. |

---

### **Key Takeaways**
✅ CAS is **lock-free**, making it faster than locks.  
✅ Used in **high-performance, concurrent programming** (e.g., `ConcurrentHashMap`).  
✅ Can suffer from **ABA problems**, solved using `AtomicStampedReference`.  

## **Creating a ConcurrentHashMap in Java**

### **Example 1: Basic Usage**
```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class ConcurrentHashMapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ConcurrentHashMap<String, Integer> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

        map.put("Alice", 25);
        map.put("Bob", 30);
        map.putIfAbsent("Charlie", 28);

        System.out.println("Age of Bob: " + map.get("Bob"));
    }
}
```
### **Output:**
```
Age of Bob: 30
```

---

### **Example 2: Multi-Threaded Access**
```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class ConcurrentAccessDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ConcurrentHashMap<String, Integer> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

        Runnable writer = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                map.put("Key" + i, i);
            }
        };

        Runnable reader = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                System.out.println("Reading Key" + i + " = " + map.get("Key" + i));
            }
        };

        Thread t1 = new Thread(writer);
        Thread t2 = new Thread(reader);
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

## **When to Use ConcurrentHashMap?** ✅
✔ **Multi-threaded applications** where multiple threads need to read/write simultaneously.  
✔ **Caching and real-time analytics**, where updates should not block reads.  
✔ **Thread-safe counters and accumulators** without global locks.  
✔ **Logging systems** where concurrent writes must be efficient.  

## **When NOT to Use ConcurrentHashMap?** ❌
✘ If **synchronization of the entire map** is required (`Collections.synchronizedMap()` is better).  
✘ When null keys/values are needed (`HashMap` or `Hashtable` allows null values).  
✘ If only a **single thread** is used, a regular `HashMap` is more efficient.
