# Generics in Java

## Overview
Generics in Java provide a way to create classes, interfaces, and methods with type parameters. This allows for **stronger type checks** at compile time, **code reusability**, and **elimination of type casting**. In this lecture, we will cover various aspects of generics through different topics, each in its respective subfolder.

### Topics Covered
Each subfolder will contain a detailed explanation and code examples for the following topics:

1. **Introduction to Generics (`_intro`)**  
   - What are generics?
   - Benefits of using generics
   - Basic syntax and examples

2. **Generic Classes (`2_genericsClasses`)**  
   - Defining generic classes
   - Creating instances of generic classes
   - Using multiple type parameters

3. **Generic Interfaces (`genericsInterface`)**  
   - Defining generic interfaces
   - Implementing generic interfaces
   - Real-world examples

4. **Bounded Type Parameters (`boundedTypeParameter`)**  
   - Using `extends` for upper bounds
   - Using `super` for lower bounds
   - When to use bounded type parameters

5. **Generics in Enums (`genericInEnum`)**  
   - Using generics inside enum classes
   - Enum generics with static methods
   - Practical applications

6. **Generic Constructors (`genericConstructor`)**  
   - Defining generic constructors
   - Difference between generic classes and constructors
   - Examples of generic constructors in Java

7. **Generic Methods (`genericMethod`)**  
   - Creating methods with type parameters
   - How generic methods differ from generic classes
   - Practical examples and best practices

8. **Wildcards in Generics (`wildcardInGeneric`)**  
   - Understanding wildcards (`?`)
   - Upper-bounded and lower-bounded wildcards
   - When to use wildcards in real-world applications

9. **Type Erasure (`typeEraser`)**  
   - How Java handles generics at runtime
   - Impact of type erasure on performance and safety
   - Workarounds and best practices

10. **Generics in Exceptions (`genericInExceptions`)**  
   - Why Java restricts generics in exceptions
   - Workarounds for using generics with exceptions
   - Alternative approaches for handling generic exceptions

By the end of this lecture, you will have a **comprehensive understanding of generics in Java** and how to use them effectively in different scenarios.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
