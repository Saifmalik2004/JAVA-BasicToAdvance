# Java Memory Management: Stack and Heap

## Introduction
Java memory management is the process of handling how variables and objects are stored in your program. It’s super important because it helps avoid memory-related problems, like running out of memory or your program crashing. Java’s JVM (Java Virtual Machine) makes memory management easier by dividing it into specific areas.

In this guide, we’ll explain memory management in simple terms, focusing on the **stack** and **heap**—the two main areas where Java stores data.

## How Java Manages Memory
The JVM divides memory into different areas:

1. **Method Area**: Stores information about classes, like method definitions and static variables.
2. **Stack Memory**: Used for method execution and local variables.
3. **Heap Memory**: Where objects and instance variables are stored.

Let’s dive into the stack and heap, the two most important areas.

## Stack Memory

### What is the Stack?
The stack is like a notepad where Java keeps track of what’s happening inside methods. It stores:
- **Method calls**
- **Local variables** (variables created inside methods)

The stack works like a pile of books—when you finish with the book on top (a method), you remove it. This is called **Last In, First Out (LIFO)**.

### Key Points About Stack Memory
- Each thread has its own stack.
- Memory is automatically freed when a method is finished.
- It’s fast and efficient.

### Example
```java
public class StackExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 10; // Local variable in stack
        printNumber(x);
    }

    public static void printNumber(int number) {
        int y = number + 5; // Another local variable
        System.out.println(y);
    }
}
```
In this example, `x` and `y` are stored in the stack, and they disappear when their methods are done.

## Heap Memory

### What is the Heap?
The heap is where Java stores objects and their data. Unlike the stack, the heap is more like a storage room—it keeps things until you don’t need them anymore.

### Key Points About Heap Memory
- Shared by all threads.
- Used for objects and instance variables.
- Managed by the **Garbage Collector**, which automatically removes unused objects.
- Slower than stack memory.

### Example
```java
public class HeapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person person = new Person("Alice"); // Object in heap
        System.out.println(person.getName());
    }
}

class Person {
    private String name; // Instance variable in heap

    public Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}
```
In this code, the `Person` object and its `name` variable are stored in the heap.

## Stack vs. Heap: What Goes Where?

### Local Variables
- **Stored in the stack.**
- Exist only while the method is running.
```java
public void calculate() {
    int result = 10; // Stored in stack
}
```

### Instance Variables
- **Stored in the heap.**
- Belong to objects and exist as long as the object exists.
```java
class Car {
    String model; // Stored in heap
}
```

### Static Variables
- Stored in the **method area** (not in stack or heap).
- Shared by all instances of a class.
```java
class Counter {
    static int count; // Stored in method area
}
```

## FAQs

### 1. What happens if the stack is full?
When the stack runs out of space, Java throws a **`StackOverflowError`**. This usually happens with deep or infinite recursion.

### 2. What happens if the heap is full?
When the heap runs out of space, Java throws an **`OutOfMemoryError`**. You can prevent this by optimizing your code or increasing the heap size.

### 3. Can local and instance variables have the same name?
Yes! If they do, the local variable takes priority inside the method. Use `this` to access the instance variable.
```java
class Test {
    int value = 10; // Instance variable

    public void setValue(int value) { // Local variable
        this.value = value; // Access instance variable
    }
}
```

### 4. How does garbage collection work?
The garbage collector removes objects from the heap when they’re no longer used. For example, when there are no references to an object, it becomes eligible for garbage collection.
