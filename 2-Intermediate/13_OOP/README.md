# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

This directory contains various concepts related to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Each subdirectory or file within this folder represents an individual OOP concept with explanations and examples.

## Overview of OOP Concepts

In this chapter, we are going to learn about the four pillars of OOP. The following directories contain explanations for each:

- **Encapsulation** – Restricting direct access to some components.
- **Abstraction** – Hiding implementation details and exposing only necessary parts.
- **Inheritance** – Deriving new classes from existing ones.
- **Polymorphism** – Allowing entities to take multiple forms.

### Why Use OOP?

OOP helps in creating modular, reusable, and scalable code by organizing data and behavior into objects. It improves code maintainability, reduces redundancy, and enhances security through encapsulation.

### Real-World Example

Consider a **Car** as an object in OOP. It has properties like `color`, `brand`, and `engineType` (Encapsulation). Different car models share common features but have unique functionalities (Inheritance). A car can be driven using different driving modes (Polymorphism). The internal workings of the engine are hidden from the driver, exposing only essential operations like accelerating or braking (Abstraction).

Each subdirectory contains a dedicated `README.md` file with explanations and code examples for the respective concept.
