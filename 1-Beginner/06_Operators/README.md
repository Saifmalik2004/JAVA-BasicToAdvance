# 📚 Java Learning Repository: Operators in Java

## 🚀 Introduction to Operators
Operators are the building blocks of any programming language, and Java is no exception! Think of operators as tools 🛠️ that help you perform operations on variables and values. From simple arithmetic to complex logical comparisons, operators enable us to write meaningful and functional code.

Without operators, it would be impossible to do basic tasks like addition, decision-making, or even checking conditions in programs. Learning how to use them is essential for every programmer!

## 📖 What Are Operators?
An operator is a symbol or keyword in Java that performs specific operations on variables and values. These operations can range from mathematical calculations to logical decisions or comparisons.

For example:
- `+` is used to add two numbers.
- `>` is used to compare two values to see which one is greater.
- `&&` is used to check multiple conditions in one go.

### ✨ Why Are Operators Important?
- They make the code concise and readable.
- Help in decision-making and flow control.
- Enable data manipulation and processing.

## 🧠 Key Concepts and Terminologies
### 1. **Operands**
Operands are the values or variables on which the operator acts. For example:
```java
int result = 5 + 3;
```
Here, `5` and `3` are operands, and `+` is the operator.

### 2. **Unary, Binary, and Ternary Operators**
- **Unary**: Works with a single operand. E.g., `-a` (negation).
- **Binary**: Works with two operands. E.g., `a + b` (addition).
- **Ternary**: Works with three operands. E.g., `a > b ? a : b` (conditional operator).

### 3. **Operator Precedence**
The order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. For example, multiplication (`*`) is evaluated before addition (`+`).

## 🍎 Real-World Analogies for Beginners

- **Arithmetic Operators**: Imagine you’re at a grocery store 🍭. You add apples and oranges to your basket using `+`, and subtract the discount using `-`.
- **Relational Operators**: Think of comparing two exam scores 🎓. You might use `>` to check which score is higher.
- **Logical Operators**: Picture deciding whether to go outside. You’ll check if the weather is sunny `&&` it’s not too hot 🌞.

## 🛠️ Types of Operators in Java
### 1. **Arithmetic Operators**
Used for basic mathematical operations:
- `+` (Addition)
- `-` (Subtraction)
- `*` (Multiplication)
- `/` (Division)
- `%` (Modulus - gives remainder)

👉 Example use: Add two numbers together.

### 2. **Relational Operators**
Used to compare two values:
- `>` (Greater than)
- `<` (Less than)
- `>=` (Greater than or equal to)
- `<=` (Less than or equal to)
- `==` (Equal to)
- `!=` (Not equal to)

👉 Example use: Check if one age is greater than another.

### 3. **Logical Operators**
Used to combine multiple conditions:
- `&&` (Logical AND)
- `||` (Logical OR)
- `!` (Logical NOT)

👉 Example use: Check if a user is eligible for a discount based on multiple criteria.

### 4. **Assignment Operators**
Used to assign values to variables:
- `=` (Assign)
- `+=` (Add and assign)
- `-=` (Subtract and assign)
- `*=` (Multiply and assign)
- `/=` (Divide and assign)

👉 Example use: Update a counter value.

### 5. **Increment and Decrement Operators**
Used to increase or decrease a value by 1:
- `++` (Increment)
- `--` (Decrement)

👉 Example use: Add 1 to a score after a correct answer.

### 6. **Ternary Operator**
A compact way to write conditional statements:
- Syntax: `condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false`

👉 Example use: Determine if a student passed based on their score.

## ❓ FAQs and Common Misconceptions

### 1. **What is the difference between `=` and `==`?**
- `=` is an **assignment operator** that assigns a value to a variable.
- `==` is a **relational operator** that checks if two values are equal.

### 2. **Can I use multiple logical operators in one condition?**
Yes! For example:
```java
if (age > 18 && isRegistered) {
    System.out.println("Eligible to vote");
}
```

### 3. **Does operator precedence matter?**
Absolutely! For example:
```java
int result = 5 + 3 * 2; // result is 11, not 16
```
Multiplication is evaluated before addition.

## 🔄 Operator Precedence and Associativity

When multiple operators are in a single expression, **precedence** decides which operator is evaluated first. **Associativity** determines the direction (left-to-right or right-to-left) when operators have the same precedence.

### 🔑 Key Precedence Rules (Highest to Lowest):  
1. **Parentheses `()`**  
2. **Unary Operators (`+`, `-`, `++`, `--`, `!`)**  
3. **Multiplication, Division, Modulus (`*`, `/`, `%`)**  
4. **Addition and Subtraction (`+`, `-`)**  
5. **Relational Operators (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)**  
6. **Equality Operators (`==`, `!=`)**  
7. **Logical AND (`&&`)**  
8. **Logical OR (`||`)**  
9. **Assignment Operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.)**

### 📌 Example:  
In the expression `int result = 5 + 3 * 2;` multiplication happens before addition because it has a higher precedence.
