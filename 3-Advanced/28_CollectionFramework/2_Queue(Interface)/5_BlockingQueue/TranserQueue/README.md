Here’s a structured **README** for the **TransferQueue** topic in Java, following the hierarchy and teaching approach similar to the previous topics.

# **TransferQueue in Java** 🚀  

## **1️⃣ Introduction**  
In Java, **TransferQueue** is a specialized type of **BlockingQueue** that allows producers to **wait** until their elements are consumed by a consumer. This makes it different from regular queues, where producers can add elements without knowing when they will be consumed.

The **TransferQueue** interface was introduced in **Java 7** as part of the `java.util.concurrent` package and is implemented by **LinkedTransferQueue**.

📌 **Why is TransferQueue important?**  
- Ensures **direct handoff** between producers and consumers when needed.
- Supports **asynchronous** and **synchronous** data transfers.
- Provides **better efficiency** in highly concurrent environments.

## **2️⃣ Hierarchy of TransferQueue**  
TransferQueue is a sub-interface of **BlockingQueue**, which in turn extends **Queue** and **Collection**.

```
Iterable  
│  
├── Collection  
│   ├── Queue (Interface)  
│   │   ├── BlockingQueue (Interface)  
│   │   │   ├── TransferQueue (Interface) ✅ (Our Focus!)  
│   │   │   │   ├── LinkedTransferQueue (Class) ✅ (Implementation)
```

### **TransferQueue vs. Other Queues**  
| Feature               | BlockingQueue | TransferQueue |
|-----------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Allows waiting to consume | ❌ | ✅ |
| Supports capacity limits | ✅ | ✅ |
| Supports priority elements | ✅ (PriorityBlockingQueue) | ❌ |
| Supports both synchronous & async transfers | ❌ | ✅ |

## **3️⃣ Key Concepts & Terminologies**  

🔹 **`transfer(E e)`** - Adds an element and waits until a consumer takes it.   
🔹 **`tryTransfer(E e)`** - Transfers the element **only if** a consumer is ready.  
🔹 **`tryTransfer(E e, timeout, unit)`** - Waits for a given time before giving up.  
🔹 **`hasWaitingConsumer()`** - Checks if any consumers are waiting.  
🔹 **`getWaitingConsumerCount()`** - Returns the number of waiting consumers.  

📌 **Key difference from BlockingQueue:** In **TransferQueue**, producers can wait until the consumer takes an element, ensuring a true handoff.

## **4️⃣ Real-World Analogy** 🏪  

**Think of TransferQueue like a restaurant counter** 🍽️  

- A **BlockingQueue** is like placing an order at a counter and then walking away (the chef will eventually make it).  
- A **TransferQueue** is like placing an order **only if** a customer is already waiting to take it.  

👨‍🍳 **Example:**  
- The chef (producer) places food **only** if a waiter (consumer) is there to take it immediately.  
- If the waiter is not present, the chef must wait.

## **5️⃣ When to Use TransferQueue?**  

✔ **Event-driven Systems** → Where an event should be processed as soon as it is generated.  
✔ **Message Passing** → Ensuring that messages are immediately consumed when produced.  
✔ **Parallel Task Execution** → Where producers and consumers should work in sync.

## **6️⃣ Code Example: Using TransferQueue in Java**  

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class TransferQueueExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TransferQueue<String> queue = new LinkedTransferQueue<>();

        // Consumer Thread
        new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                System.out.println("Consumer waiting...");
                String message = queue.take(); // Waits until producer transfers an element
                System.out.println("Consumed: " + message);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        }).start();

        // Producer Thread
        new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                Thread.sleep(2000); // Simulate delay
                System.out.println("Producer transferring item...");
                queue.transfer("Hello, World!");
                System.out.println("Item transferred!");
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        }).start();
    }
}
```

### **🔹 Expected Output:**  
```
Consumer waiting...
Producer transferring item...
Consumed: Hello, World!
Item transferred!
```

## **6️⃣ TransferQueue Methods with Examples**  

### **1️⃣ transfer(E e)**
📌 Adds an element to the queue and waits until a consumer takes it.  
🔹 **Use case:** Ensures the message is received before proceeding.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class TransferExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        TransferQueue<String> queue = new LinkedTransferQueue<>();

        // Consumer Thread
        new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                System.out.println("Consumer waiting...");
                String message = queue.take();
                System.out.println("Consumed: " + message);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        }).start();

        Thread.sleep(2000); // Simulate delay

        // Producer
        System.out.println("Producer transferring item...");
        queue.transfer("Hello, World!");
        System.out.println("Item transferred!");
    }
}
```

### **2️⃣ tryTransfer(E e)**
📌 Adds an element **only if** a consumer is already waiting.  
🔹 **Use case:** Ensures immediate consumption without blocking.

```java
TransferQueue<Integer> queue = new LinkedTransferQueue<>();

boolean success = queue.tryTransfer(42);
System.out.println("Transfer successful? " + success);
```

🛑 **Output:**  
```
Transfer successful? false
```
🔹 Since no consumer was waiting, the transfer failed.

### **3️⃣ tryTransfer(E e, long timeout, TimeUnit unit)**
📌 Tries to transfer an element but **waits for a given time** if no consumer is available.  

```java
TransferQueue<String> queue = new LinkedTransferQueue<>();

boolean transferred = queue.tryTransfer("Hello", 2, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
System.out.println("Transferred? " + transferred);
```

### **4️⃣ hasWaitingConsumer()**
📌 Returns `true` if at least one consumer is waiting.

```java
if (queue.hasWaitingConsumer()) {
    System.out.println("A consumer is waiting!");
} else {
    System.out.println("No consumer is waiting.");
}
```

### **5️⃣ getWaitingConsumerCount()**
📌 Returns the number of waiting consumers.

```java
System.out.println("Waiting consumers: " + queue.getWaitingConsumerCount());
```

## **7️⃣ FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) 🤔**  

### **Q1: How is TransferQueue different from other blocking queues?**  
✅ Unlike **BlockingQueue**, TransferQueue ensures **direct handoff** between producer and consumer. A producer waits until the element is taken.  

### **Q2: When should I use `transfer()` instead of `put()`?**  
✅ Use `transfer()` when you need **immediate consumption**. If you use `put()`, the element can be added even if no consumer is available.  

### **Q3: Can I use TransferQueue with multiple consumers?**  
✅ Yes, multiple consumers can take elements from the queue. The first available consumer will receive the transferred element.
