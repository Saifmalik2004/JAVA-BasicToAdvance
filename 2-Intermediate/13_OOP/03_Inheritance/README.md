# üñ•Ô∏è Inheritance in Java: A Step-by-Step Guide for Beginners to Advanced Learners

## üìå Introduction

Inheritance is one of the **four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Java. It's a mechanism that allows a class (child) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from another class (parent). 

Imagine you‚Äôre building a family tree where a child inherits certain traits from their parents, like eye color or height. Similarly, in Java, a child class can reuse, extend, or modify the functionality of a parent class. 

### Why is Inheritance Important?

1. **Code Reusability**: Write once, use many times. You don‚Äôt have to duplicate code for similar functionality.
2. **Maintainability**: Changes in the parent class automatically reflect in the child class.
3. **Polymorphism**: Inheritance enables **runtime polymorphism**. This allows a single method or interface to behave differently based on the object it is applied to. We will learn more about polymorphism in detail later.

## üåü Key Concepts and Terminologies

### 1. **Parent Class (Super Class)**  
   The class whose properties and methods are inherited.  
   Example: `Vehicle` class.

### 2. **Child Class (Sub Class)**  
   The class that inherits the parent class.  
   Example: `Car` class inherits `Vehicle`.

### 3. **`extends` Keyword**  
   Used to specify that a class inherits another.  

### 4. **Method Overriding**  
   When a child class provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in the parent class.

### 5. **`super` Keyword**  
   Refers to the immediate parent class. It‚Äôs used to call the parent class‚Äôs constructor or methods.

## üõ†Ô∏è Types of Inheritance in Java

### 1. **Single-Level Inheritance**
In single-level inheritance, one class inherits from another.  
#### Example:
```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal can eat.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.eat(); // Inherited from Animal
        dog.bark(); // Defined in Dog
    }
}
```

#### Output:
```
This animal can eat.
The dog barks.
```

### 2. **Multi-Level Inheritance**
In multi-level inheritance, a class inherits from a child class, which in turn inherits from a parent class.  
#### Example:
```java
class Vehicle {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle started.");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    void drive() {
        System.out.println("Car is driving.");
    }
}

class SportsCar extends Car {
    void turboBoost() {
        System.out.println("Turbo boost activated!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SportsCar sc = new SportsCar();
        sc.start();       // From Vehicle
        sc.drive();       // From Car
        sc.turboBoost();  // From SportsCar
    }
}
```

#### Output:
```
Vehicle started.
Car is driving.
Turbo boost activated!
```

### 3. **Multiple Inheritance (Not Allowed in Java)**  
Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes to avoid ambiguity. For example, if two parent classes have a method with the same name, the child class will face a conflict. Instead, Java allows multiple inheritance through **interfaces**.

#### Example of Ambiguity:
```java
class A {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("Class A");
    }
}

class B {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("Class B");
    }
}

// Not allowed in Java
class C extends A, B { }
```

## ‚ö° Real-World Analogy
Imagine a **library system**:
- `Library` (Parent): Contains common properties like name and location.
- `PublicLibrary` (Child): Adds properties like community programs.
- `DigitalLibrary` (Child): Adds properties like eBooks.

## ü§î FAQs and Common Misconceptions

### Q1: Why does Java not allow multiple inheritance with classes?  
**A**: It prevents ambiguity and complexity that arises when two parent classes have methods with the same name.

### Q2: Can a child class override all parent methods?  
**A**: Not all. Methods marked `final` in the parent class cannot be overridden.

### Q3: What is the difference between `this` and `super`?  
**A**:  
- `this`: Refers to the current class object.  
- `super`: Refers to the parent class object.
