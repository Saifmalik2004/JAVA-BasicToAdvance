# JDBC Components - Understanding the Building Blocks

## Introduction
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) consists of various components that work together to enable seamless interaction between Java applications and relational databases. Understanding these components is crucial for writing efficient and maintainable database-driven applications.

## Key JDBC Components
JDBC provides several core components that facilitate communication between Java applications and databases. These include:

### 1. **JDBC API**
The JDBC API defines the classes and interfaces that allow Java applications to interact with databases.
- **Key Interfaces and Classes:**
  - `DriverManager` â€“ Manages database drivers and connection requests.
  - `Connection` â€“ Establishes a connection to the database.
  - `Statement` â€“ Used to execute static SQL queries.
  - `PreparedStatement` â€“ Executes parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
  - `ResultSet` â€“ Holds the result of executed queries.
  
### 2. **JDBC Driver**
A JDBC driver acts as a bridge between Java applications and databases. There are four types of JDBC drivers:
- **Type 1: JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver** (Least used, requires ODBC driver)
- **Type 2: Native API Driver** (Uses vendor-specific native libraries)
- **Type 3: Network Protocol Driver** (Translates JDBC calls into a database-independent network protocol)
- **Type 4: Thin Driver (Pure Java)** (Most widely used, directly interacts with the database over TCP/IP)

### 3. **DriverManager**
- The `DriverManager` class is responsible for managing database drivers and establishing connections.
- Example usage:
  ```java
  Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb", "user", "password");
  ```

### 4. **Connection**
- Represents a connection between a Java application and a database.
- Used to create SQL statements and manage transactions.
- Example:
  ```java
  Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password);
  ```

### 5. **Statement**
- Used to execute SQL queries.
- Example:
  ```java
  Statement stmt = con.createStatement();
  ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM users");
  ```

### 6. **PreparedStatement**
- A subclass of `Statement` that allows precompiled SQL queries.
- Prevents SQL injection.
- Example:
  ```java
  PreparedStatement pstmt = con.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?");
  pstmt.setInt(1, 10);
  ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery();
  ```

### 7. **ResultSet**
- Holds the results of a SQL query.
- Used to iterate over database records.
- Example:
  ```java
  while (rs.next()) {
      System.out.println("User ID: " + rs.getInt("id"));
  }
  ```

## Conclusion
JDBC components provide a structured way for Java applications to interact with databases. Understanding these components allows developers to write efficient database-driven applications while ensuring security and performance.
